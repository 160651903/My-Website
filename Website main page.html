<h1> Puppy training</h1> 
 
<p> This is the first stages of training your puppy. </p>    

<p> Puppies are so cute but you need to know how to look after them properly, I am going to explain how you teach them the basics: first of all sit is a very well known trick they must learn you teach them to sit by getting a treat and showing it to them once they are drawn to it lift the treat up if they are still making eye contact with it then once they fully look up they will be in a sitting position when they are say "sit" and reward with the treat continue this and eventually with repetition the will grasp the concept and begin being able to do this trick with no treat.next is lay down this is a more challenging trick to teach your dog but if they know sit it should be no bouther so you tell them to sit and reward then lure with the treat is the are watching the treat then they will push there front paws down and find themselves in the laying down position.Dont worry if it doesnt happen first try it takes many dogs multiple trys to get this trick. just persevere and eventually with reinforcement they will be doing bouth sit and lay down with no treat. Now your puppy has learnt the basics of training. </p>
